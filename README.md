Heart Rate Module

We send heart rate data to all modules using the Pulse Sensor and Arduino UNO. Our data is personlized to modules upon request. The data we send entails the BPM of the user along with tags. Tags are words/phrases that analyse the current BPM recieved by the sensor. This is where our personalization comes into play. Depending on what module requests data, we send out tags/analysis to cater their particular needs.
